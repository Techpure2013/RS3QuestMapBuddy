# Little Walk Around:

## You have the:

- New Quest - Sets up a new quest
- Load Quest - Pulls up a File Explorer to load a quest
- Save - Saves the quest as is. Works as save as in alt1 browser
- Save As - Alt1's alternative to a safer save.
- The Step Description Section
  - You can edit the step description section with the checkbox checked
- Items Needed and Recommended Boxes
  - Change the items needed and recommended as needed
- Step Increase/Decrese Floor Increase/Decrease
  - Floor saves as you proceed to the next step
  - Add and Delete Step works as intended
- Targets NPC/Object
  - Select whether you are targeting an npc or object
  - Target index follows the step index
  - Name/Object Input if you need help searching for a npc below it is a NPC Search Bar (Must hit choose npc before continuing) if there is no npc to the name just type the npc in there correctly and a Chathead would pop up on click in the map area
  - Map Search: If you need to know where a npc is but its not showing in the search bar you can travel to for example: Blue Moon Inn cellar and it will fly you over to that location so you can input that npc or object
  - Area Radius tools: puts radius around the npc or object, Objects are a little more special being able to discern by color and number what an object is.
  - Text Area at the bottom: The file you are editing each section changes the file in this section.
